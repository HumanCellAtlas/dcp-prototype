## Pull Request Protocols

The followings guidelines allows the core developers to manage the workload of performing PR reviews with a 24 hour SLO more manageable. 

- Please do not request code reviews for PRs that are failing unit tests, deployment, or lint, unless it was failing prior to your PR (in which case I’d recommend figuring out why it was failing prior to your PR to make sure it is being addressed).
- Please do not request code reviews on draft PRs unless you’re specifically asking for someone to scan something or validate (in which case, please Slack them beforehand).
- Once you’ve fully addressed all the comments, please re-request a review and/or offline ping. Sometimes it is difficult figuring out which PRs have fully addressed all the comments and which ones have not.
- Please resolve comments that have been addressed.
- If someone has not responded on a PR for a while, please ping directly on Slack. It’s preferable that PRs get closed instead of waiting indefinitely for someone to review while new PRs keep piling up.
